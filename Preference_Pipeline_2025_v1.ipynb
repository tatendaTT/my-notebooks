    "**Overall Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The script simulates multiple agents exploring a structured, colored graph. Each agent has a specific color preference and aims to find a certain number of nodes matching that preference within a step limit. After the simulations, the script clusters the agents' traversal paths based on features derived from these paths (specifically \"Bag-of-Colors\") and evaluates how well these clusters correspond to the agents' original color preferences. It focuses on a specific configuration using a structured graph *without* noise and a deterministic agent strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Imports:** Imports necessary libraries for graph manipulation (`networkx`), plotting (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`), data handling (`pandas`, `numpy`), feature extraction and clustering (`sklearn`), distance metrics and hierarchical clustering (`scipy`), optimization for label remapping (`scipy.optimize`), timing (`time`), file operations (`os`), and warnings management (`warnings`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`Agent` Class (V5.1):**\n",
    "    * Defines an agent that traverses the graph.\n",
    "    * **Initialization:** Takes a start node, a `color_preference`, a `target_preferred_count` (goal), and `max_steps`.\n",
    "    * **`find_next_node`:** Implements the core movement logic. It uses a **deterministic preference strategy**: If unvisited neighbors matching the `color_preference` exist, it *always* chooses randomly among them. Otherwise, it chooses randomly from *any* other unvisited neighbors. Includes an explicit loop fix for robustness.\n",
    "    * **`traverse_graph`:** Simulates the agent's walk, calling `find_next_node` repeatedly until the goal is met, `max_steps` are reached, or the agent gets stuck. It records the path taken, visited node attributes (color, shape, shiny), and counts the preferred nodes found.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **`generate_structured_colored_graph` Function:**\n",
    "    * Creates a `networkx` graph where nodes are assigned colors, shapes, and shininess attributes.\n",
    "    * The coloring is structured: nodes are primarily assigned to color \"regions,\" but a `noise_level` parameter (set to 0.0 in the main block) allows for some nodes to randomly get a different color.\n",
    "    * Edges are added randomly based on an `edge_probability`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **`simulate_agents` Function:**\n",
    "    * Orchestrates the simulation runs.\n",
    "    * Takes a graph, number of agents, traversals per agent, seeds, etc.\n",
    "    * Initializes multiple `Agent` instances with random start nodes and color preferences.\n",
    "    * Runs `traverse_graph` for each agent traversal.\n",
    "    * Collects detailed results (path, steps, found count, path properties, visited attributes) into a `pandas.DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Feature Engineering & Distance Functions:**\n",
    "    * `jaccard_distance`: Calculates Jaccard distance between sets (likely node paths).\n",
    "    * `extract_boc_features`: Extracts **Bag-of-Colors (BoC)** features from the sequence of colors visited by each agent using `CountVectorizer`.\n",
    "    * `extract_combined_features`: Combines BoC with numerical features.\n",
    "    * `calculate_distance_matrix`: Calculates distance matrices (e.g., using Jaccard) or extracts feature matrices (BoC, combined) based on the specified method.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **`cluster_and_evaluate` Function:**\n",
    "    * Performs clustering on the simulation data (grouped by simulation seed).\n",
    "    * Takes the simulation DataFrame, number of clusters (`n_clusters`), feature/distance method, and clustering algorithm (`cluster_method`) as input.\n",
    "    * Calculates distances/features for each seed's data.\n",
    "    * Applies the chosen clustering algorithm (e.g., 'kmeans', 'ward').\n",
    "    * Evaluates the clustering results using:\n",
    "        * **Silhouette Score:** Measures cluster cohesion and separation.\n",
    "        * **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) & Normalized Mutual Information (NMI):** Compare cluster assignments to the 'ground truth' (agent's `Color Preference`).\n",
    "        * **Cluster Color Purity/Percentage:** Calculates the distribution of visited colors within each cluster.\n",
    "    * Returns a summary DataFrame of evaluation metrics and the original DataFrame with added cluster labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Plotting Functions:**\n",
    "    * `plot_colored_graph`: Visualizes the generated graph structure. (Not called in the main block).\n",
    "    * `plot_color_confusion_matrix`: Creates a heatmap comparing the true color preferences against the assigned cluster labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Main Execution Block (`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`)**\n",
    "    * **Sets Parameters:** Defines graph size, colors, simulation runs, agent goals (`TARGET_PREFERRED_COUNT`, `MAX_STEPS`), graph structure (`GRAPH_NOISE_LEVEL = 0.0`), and clustering parameters (`FEATURE_DISTANCE_METHOD = 'boc'`, `CLUSTER_METHOD = 'kmeans'`, `N_CLUSTERS = 5`).\n",
    "    * **Runs Workflow:**\n",
    "        1.  Loops through multiple simulation seeds.\n",
    "        2.  Generates a structured graph *without noise*.\n",
    "        3.  Runs `simulate_agents` using the Agent V.\n",
    "        4.  Concatenates results.\n",
    "        5.  Calls `cluster_and_evaluate` using BoC features and KMeans.\n",
    "        6.  Prints and saves the evaluation summary.\n",
    "        7.  **Optimal Cluster Label Remapping:** Attempts to reorder the KMeans cluster labels using the Hungarian algorithm (`linear_sum_assignment`) to best align with the true color preferences, making the confusion matrix more interpretable.\n",
    "        8.  Generates and saves the confusion matrix plot using the *remapped* cluster labels (or original labels if remapping fails).\n",
    "    * **Output:** Creates a directory containing a CSV summary of clustering results and a confusion matrix PNG image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary, the script sets up and runs an experiment to test if KMeans clustering applied to Bag-of-Colors features derived from agent traversals (using a deterministic preference strategy on a noise-free structured graph) can effectively group agents based on their intended color preference. It includes an advanced step to optimally align cluster labels for clearer visualization**"
